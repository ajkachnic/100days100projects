        <p>Thanks to everyone who supported me(or didn't) along this journey. I learned a lot and this really helped me get better at rapidly building projects. I'm planning on writing an article about this challenge, so stay tuned for that</p>
        <p>I'll try and keep this short so I don't ramble on. I think this was a massive success and I recommend this to anyone who is thinking of trying it.</p>
        <p>To reiterate, thanks - Andrew Kachnic</p>
